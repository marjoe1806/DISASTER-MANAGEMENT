# Project Description: Emergency Response and Mapping System


### 🔍 **Project Description: Emergency Response and Mapping System**

The **Emergency Response and Mapping System** is a web-based application designed to facilitate user registration, authentication, and basic data storage for managing emergency responders or incidents. Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this system utilizes `localStorage` for saving user credentials and personal information without a backend server.

#### 🎯 **Core Features**

* **User Registration**: Allows users to input their login credentials and personal information (e.g., name, email, contact, gender) categorized clearly in the form.
* **Login System**: Validates user credentials from `localStorage` and grants access to the system.
* **Local Data Persistence**: All data is saved locally on the user's browser using `localStorage`.
* **Responsive Design**: Simple, clean user interface optimized for desktop and mobile.

#### 🧩 **Technology Stack**

* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
* **Data Storage**: Browser `localStorage` (no server or database)

#### 📦 **Use Cases**

* Small-scale emergency response apps
* Prototypes or offline tools for disaster preparedness drills
* Educational demos for local data handling and web development
